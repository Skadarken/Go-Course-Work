History:
    -> Designed by Robert Greisemer, Rob Pike and Ken Thompson at Google in 2007
    -> Motivated by shared dislike of C++ (Verify this)
    -> Public announcement in November 2009 and released in March 2012


REASONS TO BUILD GO:
    -> Emergence of Scalable and Distributed Computing
    -> Networking Clusters
    -> Dynamic Computing
    -> Existing languages at the time did not take advantage of the infrastructure or were unable to due to design limitations

FEATURES:
    -> Server-side language
    -> Designed to run on multiple cores
    -> Supports Concurrency
    -> Concurrency is easy
    -> Combines Readability of Python and Efficiency and Safety of C++
    -> Fast Build, Start-up and Run time
    -> Compiled Language -> Compiles directly into Machine code
    -> 

USE CASES:
    -> Writing Performant Applications
    -> Run on Scaled, Distributed Systems

PRODUCTS BUILT USING GO:
    -> Docker
    -> Kubernetes
    -> CockroachDB
    -> Hashicorp Vault
